Lord how are they increased that trouble me
many are they that rise up against me
many there be which say of my soul
there is no help for him in God
selah
but you oh Lord are a shield for me
my glory and the lifter up of my head
I cried to the Lord with my voice and he heard me out of his holy hill
selah
I laid me down and slept
I awaked
for the Lord sustained me
I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people
that have set themselves against me round about
arise oh Lord save me oh my God
for you have smitten all my enemies on the cheek bone
you have broken the teeth of the ungodly
salvation belongs to the Lord
your blessing is on your people
selah
